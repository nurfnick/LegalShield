```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
Keybrdg_LS_Removed_Redundant_Rows <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Keybrdg_LS_Removed_Redundant_Rows.csv", header=FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

Here is what I know!  You need to click in environment and import the data set.  Here I have imported ``Keybrdg_LS_Removed_Redundant_Rows.csv"  Next I will start to use that data.  So here I am with the summary statistics

```{r baf}
summary(Keybrdg_LS_Removed_Redundant_Rows)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
